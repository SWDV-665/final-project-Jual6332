# FarmingtonHillsLuxuryGarage
A mobile and web app final project for Advanced Software Topics course built using the Ionic framework and Typescript. The course is a part of the University of Maryville Master of Software Development degree.

This application builds on the Ionic Tabs example to illustrate the alert feature, custom functions, and the development of an application programming interface (API) for storing "who wants to drive?" data for the garage.
